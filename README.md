# The Pur Project
Pur, the programming language.

Pur is a programming language made in Python. Not assembly because I don't know a single bit of Assembly.

## Documentation

This is the documentation for Pur, because it's probably hard.

### Syntax

The syntax is like this:

```
print.Hi!
print.What's your name?
in.name
printv.name
```

Testing this with the input of hi would result in

```
.Hi!
.What's your name?
hi
hi
```

### Examples
These are for when you're too bored to actually learn, like me.

### 1. Name Repeater

```
print.Hi, what's your name?
in.name
print.Oh,
printv.name
print.cool name! Thanks for tryin'!
```

### 2. Info for No Reason

```
print.Info
print.This is some info for Pur.
print.It was made in Pur, too.
print.Go and watch Nutcracker tho, it's really good
```
### 3. Is It True?

```
in.yes
while.yes
printv.yes
in.yes
end.
```

As there isn't many commands right now, these were the examples.

### Commands
> There may be some non-working commands in this, such as ifvrev.

```
print.{text}
```

```
printv.{var}
```

```
in.{save as var}
```

```
ifvrev.{var}.{val}.{out var}
```

```
error.{error message}
```
```
while.{bool var}
[COMMANDS]
end.
```

Do what you want with Pur.
Hope you a good line 1!
